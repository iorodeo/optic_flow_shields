Arduino shields for use  ADNSD3080 optical flow sensors (2x). The shield also
breaks out 5V, GND, various DIO and analog inputs on a screw terminal block.
The optic flow sensors connect to the PCB via two 5x2 shrouded (keyed)
headers. 

An adaptor PCB for the ADNS3080 optic flow sensor sensor is also provided so
that the optic flow sensor can be connected to the shield via a 10-pin ribbon cable
via a 5x2 shoured header.
